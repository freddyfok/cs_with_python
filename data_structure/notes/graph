Tree is a special Graph
A graph G is an ordered pair of a set V of vertices and a set E of edges
G = (V,E)

directed or undirected
example of undirected is social network
if you have 3 friends, the 3 friend's connection can be recommended to you
the interview question can be like: find all nodes having length of shortest path from a node equal to 2

example of directed is web pages
normally you can only go from one page to another
web crawling is a graph traversal

weighted vs unweighted
intercity road, the length can represent the weight
you can use 1 to represent an unweighted graph

number of edges
for directed: n(n-1)
for undirected: n(n-1)/2

to minimum the space complexity of storing graphs,
you can pass in the vertex list array
then the edge list will point to the vertex list by referencing the array index
