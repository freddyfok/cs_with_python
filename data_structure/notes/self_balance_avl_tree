self balancing property is added to a binary tree
it helps with the skewness of the tree

what is avl balanced tree?
the difference between the left and right subtree is -1, 0, or 1
left heavy tree is positive, right heavy tree is negative

how to fix?
you want to rotate the tree
left-heavy:
1) right
2) left-right

right-heavy:
3) left
4) right-left

you check every time you insert

steps:
1) insert like regular tree
2) update the height of tree
3) find if balanced
4) rotate

AVL sort:
1) insert
2) in order traversal
