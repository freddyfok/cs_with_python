Arrays takes up a block of memory.
Each element is right after another element
Arrays are pointers in C.

Pros:
Because it is index, accessing is very fast

Cons:
- Most static language requires the size of array before compiling,
unless the array is dynamically allocated.
- Can create dynamic array with static array by creating a new array,
double the size, copy everything over
